More flooding in store overnight

We are winding down this liveblog for the evening, and here is what we know right now.

    The storm continues its slow churn inland at 3mph, with maximum sustained winds now down below 45mph.
    With some areas having already set rainfall records of more than 30in, Florence is expected to drop an additional 15in to 20in of rain over southern and central portions of North Carolina and into far north-east South Carolina.
    Officials expect this rainfall will continue to produce catastrophic flash flooding and prolonged significant river flooding.
    In North Carolina, transit officials are telling people not to travel the roads for any reason, as any non-emergency traffic is not only hazardous but can hamper relief efforts.
    The storm has claimed six confirmed lives, five in North Carolina and another in South Carolina.
